# Embedded
A collection of hands-on exercises and projects from my Advanced Embedded Systems course. 
The repository contains multiple standalone modules covering topics such as GPIO, timers, I2C communication, sensors (e.g., MPU6050), UART, and real-time embedded concepts. 
Each project is organized in its own folder and includes source code, documentation, and experiment results.

This repo serves as a personal learning space, showcasing my progress throughout the course and my growing familiarity with low-level programming, microcontrollers, and hardware/software integration.
